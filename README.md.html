# Overview

This repository includes a number of example scenes and
data for use with the [pbrt-v3](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3) renderer,
which corresponds to the system described in the third edition of
_Physically Based Rendering_, by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg
Humphreys. (See also the [pbrt website](http://pbrt.org).)

We hope that this data will be useful to users of `pbrt`, developers making
changes to the system, and researchers in rendering. To our knowledge, all
of these scenes and data can be used fairly freely. Some data is licensed
under a Creative Commons Attribution license; see details in 
Section [Overview of Scenes] of this document. 

For more information about how to convert scenes to `pbrt`'s format, see
the [pbrt User's
Guide](http://pbrt.org/users-guide.html#Converting_Scenes_to_pbrts_Format_0).

# Data Sets

In addition to example scenes, there is some useful data for use with the
system.

* [bsdfs/](bsdfs/): this directory includes a variety of bidirectional scattering
  distribution functions (BSDFs) for use with the `FourierMaterial`. See, for
  example, the [coffee-splash](coffee-splash) scene for use of such a BSDF in a scene.
  * New versions of BSDFs for use with `FourierMaterial` can be generated
    with [layerlab](https://github.com/wjakob/layerlab/).

* [lenses/](lenses/): lens description files for a handful of real-world lens
  systems, for use with the `RealisticCamera`. See the scenes
  [villa/villa-photons.pbrt](villa/villa-photons.pbrt) and
  [sanmiguel/f6-17.pbrt](sanmiguel/f6-17.pbrt) for examples of their use.

* [spds/](spds/): measured spectral power distributions for a variety of standard
  illuminants, light sources, metals, and the squares of the Macbeth color
  checker.

# Scenes

A variety of scenes are available, ranging from simple ones that show off
an individual feature of the system, to more interesting ones that
demonstrate complex lighting effects in scenes with detailed geometry and
realistic reflection models.

Scene files for many of the rendered figures in the book are included here;
for example, [dragon/f11-13.pbrt](dragon/f11-13.pbrt) corresponds to Figure
11.13 in the third edition of the book.

## Directory Organization

We've tried to organize all of the scene directories in a consistent
manner; each scene directory is self-contained, containing all of the
geometry, textures, and additional data needed to render the scene.

With a few exceptions, each `*.pbrt` file in a scene directory represents a
separate variant of the scene to be rendered (possibly with different light
source configurations, different camera positions, etc.)  Some scenes have
`geometry.pbrt`, `lights-*.pbrt` and `materials.pbrt` files that collect
common geometry and material definitions across these variants. Thus, you
should be able to just run `pbrt scene-name.pbrt` for any of the remaining
`*.pbrt` files to render the corresponding scene.

Complex triangle meshes and other complex geometry is stored in the
`geometry/` directories and texture maps are all in the respective
`textures/` directories. (Similarly, any SPDs, realistic camera lenses,
or BSDF files are stored in corresponding sub-directories.)

The [images/](images/) directory (which has a structure that parallels that
of the scene directories) has EXR and PNG files corresponding to the final
output from rendering each corresponding scene. All PNGs were generated
using the `imgtool` program from the `pbrt-v3` distribution; many had a
scale factor applied with the `--scale` command-line option, and a number
include a bit of bloom to improve visual realism (via the `--bloomlevel` 
and related command-line options.) Sometimes the corresponding `*.pbrt`
file has a comment under the `Film` directive with the command line options
that were used for `imgtool`.

## A Note about Clamped Sample Values

Some of these scenes have very difficult-to-sample light transport paths
that in turn cause high variance, which manifests itself as scattered very
bright pixels in images (often called "fireflies").  (For example, scenes
with bumpy specular surfaces that are illuminated by realistic sky environment
maps suffer from this issue when a path intersects the specular surface and
is then scattered such that it happens to intersect the sun.)

There is an option for pbrt's Film implementation that allows the user to
specify a maximum value for the luminance of any sample added to the film;
if enabled, any sample with a larger luminance has its luminance scaled
down so that it is equal to the maximum. In turn, the impact of fireflies
in images can be greatly reduced.

We have used this option for a number of challenging scenes in the
following. As such, **bias has been introduced into the the images that
pbrt generates for those scenes**. We highlight this issue for two reasons:
first, if you want to use those scenes as unbiased comparisons to another
rendering system or to your implementation of a new light transport
algorithm, it's important to be aware of this (and likely, to modify the
scene files to disable this setting). Second, if you're developing a new
light transport algorithm, these scenes provide a number of challenging
situations that current algorithms don't handle well; new algorithms that
handle them effectively would be useful contributions to rendering.

## Overview of Scenes

(##) Barcelona Pavilion

![](images/barcelona-pavilion/pavilion-day.png height="200px")

![](images/barcelona-pavilion/pavilion-night.png height="200px")

[barcelona-pavilion](barcelona-pavilion): Model of van der Rohe's classic
[Barcelona Pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Pavilion),
including both daytime and nighttime lighting setups. In the daytime setup,
all illumination comes from a realistic sky model encoded in an HDR
environment map. The night model has a very dark sky map and a number of
area light sources; it is particularly challenging to render, as much of
the illumination travels through one or more layers of glass before hitting
a surface.

barcelona-pavilion: Thanks to [Hamza Cheggour](http://www.emirage.org), who
created this [great

and made it available via a

(##) Bathroom

![](images/bathroom/bathroom.png height="200px")

[bathroom](bathroom): Modern bathroom with soft indirect lighting and
depth of field. Given the mirrors and bright wight walls, multi-bounce
indirect illumination has a substantial effect on the overall appearance
of the scene.

(##) BMW M6

![](images/bmw-m6/bmw-m6.png height="200px")

[bmw-m6](bmw-m6): BMW M6 car (model year 2006) illuminated by a realistic
skylight model.

(##) Breakfast

![](images/breakfast/breakfast-lamps.png height="200px")

[breakfast](breakfast): Indoor scene with chairs around a table. One
variant of the scene has light streaming in through blinds from the side
such that most of the scene is only illuminated indirectly; finding these
indirect illumination paths can be challenging.  Another variant is only
illuminated by the lights above the table; handling the resulting light
transport through the glass light fixtures is a good challenge for many
light transport algorithms.

![Smoky cloud](images/cloud/smoke.png height="200px")

[cloud](cloud): One scene with a bright white cloud, showing the effect of
multiple scattering in participating media, and another, with the same
volume density but with much more absorption, leading to a much darker

(##) Contemporary Bathroom

![](images/contemporary-bathroom/contemporary-bathroom.png height="200px")

[contemporary-bathroom](contemporary-bathroom): Another contemporary
bathroom scene. This scene is quite challenging to render without visible
noise: specular light transport by the large mirror and the 
very small area light sources surrounded by glass in the light bulbs are
difficult to render efficiently.
